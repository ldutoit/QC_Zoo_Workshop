May 10  2021 | Ludovic Dutoit 

## Description
With the age of high\-throughput sequencing, several techniques have been developed to

### Objectives

We only have a short time together, but whether you are a novice to the world of genomics, the world of computing I'd like to believe you can leave having learnt at least three things, whether about genomics, coding or maybe simply teaching techniques mor resources at Otago
