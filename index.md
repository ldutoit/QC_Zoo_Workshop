# Quality Control for Genomic Data

May 10 2021 | [Ludovic Dutoit](https://ldutoit.github.io)

## Description
Quality control is the first step of any genomic analysis pipleine. We'll utilise this step as a way of familiarising ourselves with genomic data structure and learning our way through the New Zealand High Performance Computing Infrastructure ([NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/)).

### Objectives

We only have a short time together, but whether you are a novice or an expert in the world of genomic and/or computing I'd like to believe you can leave this session having learnt at least three things. They could be about genomics, High Performance Computing or teaching techniques.
  
## Getting started

We'll make use of New Zealand High Performance Computing infrastructure. If you're working or studying at the University of Otago, it is practically free and unlimited computing power. It also has the advantages of being unbreakable, potentially running your analyses when you sleep or when you use your computer for other things. Finally, it comes loaded with a multiple of bioinformatic and genomic softarwes pre-installed and a highly competent, fully dedicated support team. Finally, being comfortable with such a resource is an amazing translational skill to add to your CV

* If you have a [NeSI account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/),  use it to log into the [Jupyter hub](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F). If you are not sure how, you can follow detailed instructions at [jupyter_hub.md](jupyter_hub.md). 

* If you don't have a [NeSI account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/), put your pink sticker on your computer and we'll simply you log you in. In a traditional workshop, we'd make sure every participant has access to the servers before starting the workshop. It is a powerful resource you can later use on your own. 

Once everybody is logged in, we 'll start  the lesson together : [QualityControlforGenomicData.md](QualityControlforGenomicData.md)
