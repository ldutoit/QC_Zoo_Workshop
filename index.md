# Quality Control for genomic data

May 10 2021 | [Ludovic Dutoit](https://ldutoit.github.io)

## Description
With the age of high\-throughput sequencing, several techniques have been developed to
generate huge amount of sequence data at a fraction of the cost .... . Quality control is the first step of any genomic analysis. We'll utilise this step a way of familiarising ourselves with genomic data structure and learning our way through the New Zealand High Performance Computing infrastructure.

### Objectives

We only have a short time together, but whether you are a novice or an expert in the world of genomic and/or computing I'd like to believe you can leave having learnt at least three things. They could be about genomics, High Performance Computing or teaching techniques.

## Getting started

We'll make use of New zealand supercomputing infrastructure. In a traditional workshop, we'd make sure every participant has [access to the servers] before starting the workshop. It is a powerful resource you can later use on your own. If you have a NeSI account,  use to log into the jupyter_hub.md follow the instruction at [jupyter_hub.md]. If not, put a pink stickers on your computer and I'll simply you log you in. If you are following this workshop at any other time, all you really need is a unix-based terminal.
