# Quality Control for Genomic Data

May 2021 | [Ludovic Dutoit](https://ldutoit.github.io)

## Description
Quality control is the first step of any genomic analysis pipleine. We will utilise this step as a way of familiarising ourselves with genomic data structure and learning our way through the New Zealand High Performance Computing Infrastructure ([NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/)).

## Objectives

We only have a short amount of time together, but whether you are a novice or an expert in the world of genomic and/or computing I'd like to believe you can leave this session having learnt at least three new things. They could be about genomics, High Performance Computing or teaching techniques.

## Teaching style

The teaching style of this workshop is inspired by the carpentries mode. Here are a few important points to me:

* I believe live coding is the best way to learn bioinformatics skills. You get to hear it, see it and do it. Importantly, you leave with a computer tha is able to do exactly what we have done together and not a "If I had this installed and access to that data, I could perhaps go through my notes". 

* You can signal you need help by putting the *pink* sticker on your computer or that everything is alright by putting the green sticker up. That is great because you can ask for help even if you're not comfortable interrupting the class. I usually work with helpers, great way for an advanced user like some people in this room to reinforce your skills!)
  
## Getting started

30-40 minutes is a very short amount of time to have everyone set up and going, so bear with me! We'll make use of New Zealand High Performance Computing infrastructure [NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/). If you're working or studying at the University of Otago, it is free and [practically unlimited](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000204076-Mahuika-Slurm-Partitions) computing power. It is also unbreakable and can potentially run your analyses when you sleep. It comes loaded with a multiple of bioinformatic and genomic softwares pre-installed and a highly competent, fully dedicated support team. Finally, being comfortable with such a resource is an amazing translational skill to add to your already glowing skill set!

* If you have a [NeSI account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/), use it to login at [https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/). If you are not sure how, you can follow detailed instructions at [jupyter_hub.md](jupyter_hub.md). Once you are all logged in, put the green sticker up on your computer so that I know that you are ready to go!

* If you don't have a [NeSI account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/), put the pink sticker on your computer and we'll simply log you in. In a normal workshop, we would make sure every participant has access to the servers before starting the workshop but it is not possible today. Those servers are a powerful resource you can later use on your own. You are free to apply for an account after this workshop if it feels like NeSI is a resource you might want to use further.

Once everybody is logged in, we'll **start the lesson together** : [Quality Control for Genomic Data](QualityControlforGenomicData.md)
