# Quality Control for Genomic Data

May 10 2021 | [Ludovic Dutoit](https://ldutoit.github.io)

## Description
Quality control is the first step of any genomic analysis pipleine. We will utilise this step as a way of familiarising ourselves with genomic data structure and learning our way through the New Zealand High Performance Computing Infrastructure ([NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/)).

## Objectives

We only have a short amount of time together, but whether you are a novice or an expert in the world of genomic and/or computing I'd like to believe you can leave this session having learnt at least three new things. They could be about genomics, High Performance Computing or teaching techniques.
  
## Getting started

We'll make use of New Zealand High Performance Computing infrastructure [NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/). If you're working or studying at the University of Otago, it is practically free and [unlimited](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000204076-Mahuika-Slurm-Partitions) computing power. It is also unbreakable and can potentially run your analyses when you sleep or when you use your computer for other things. It comes loaded with a multiple of bioinformatic and genomic softwares pre-installed and a highly competent, fully dedicated support team. Finally, being comfortable with such a resource is an amazing translational skill to add to your already glowing skill set!

* If you have a [NeSI account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/), use it to log into the [Jupyter hub](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F). If you are not sure how, you can follow detailed instructions at [jupyter_hub.md](jupyter_hub.md). 

* If you don't have a [NeSI account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/), put your *pink* sticker on your computer and we'll simply log you in. In a normal workshop, we would make sure every participant has access to the servers before starting the workshop but it is not possible. It is a powerful resource you can later use on your own. You are free to apply for an account after this workshop if it feels like NeSI is a resource you might want to use further.

Once everybody is logged in, we'll **start the lesson together** : [QualityControlforGenomicData.md](QualityControlforGenomicData.md)
