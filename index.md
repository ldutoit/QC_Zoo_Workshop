# Quality Control for Genomic Data

May 2021 | [Ludovic Dutoit](https://ldutoit.github.io)

## Description
Quality control is the first step of any genomic analysis pipeline. We will use this step as a way of familiarising ourselves with genomic data structure and learning our way through the New Zealand High Performance Computing Infrastructure ([NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/)).

## Objectives

We only have a short amount of time together. Whether you are a novice or an expert in the world of genomic and computing, I'd like to believe you can leave this session having learnt at least three new things. They could be about genomics, High Performance Computing or even teaching techniques.

## Teaching style

Here are a few important points for today:

* I believe **live coding** is a great way to learn bioinformatics skills. You get to *hear it, see it and do it*. It also forces a teaching speed which everyone can follow. 

* *Share and thrive*. You'll leave today with a computer that is set up to do all the things that we have done together as opposed to a vague idea of what the person in front did.  All the material is also accessible on this website. You can modify it, [suggest modifications](https://github.com/ldutoit/QC_Zoo_Workshop/issues) or share it.

* You can signal you need help by putting the *pink* sticker on your computer or that everything is alright by putting the *green* sticker up. That is great trick because you can ask for help even if you're not comfortable interrupting the class. I usually work with helpers that scan the room for pink stickers, great way for an advanced user like some people in this room to reinforce their skills!

* Everyone attending these workshops should feel that that they are in a supportive and inclusive environment. I usually refer to the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#code-of-conduct-detailed-view). If anyone is feeling uncomfortable, feel free to approach me or any Zoology staff to report an incident.
  
## Getting started

30-40 minutes is a very short amount of time to have everyone set up and going, so bear with me! We'll make use of New Zealand High Performance Computing infrastructure [NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/). If you're working or studying at the University of Otago, it is free and [practically unlimited](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000204076-Mahuika-Slurm-Partitions) computing power. It is also unbreakable and can potentially run your analyses when you sleep. It comes loaded with a multiple of bioinformatic and genomic softwares pre-installed and a highly competent, fully dedicated support team. Finally, being comfortable with such a resource is an amazing translational skill to add to your already glowing skill set!

* If you have a [NeSI account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/), use it to login at [https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/). If you are not sure how, you can follow detailed instructions at [jupyter_hub.md](jupyter_hub.md). Once you are all logged in, put the *green sticker* on your computer so that I know that you are ready to go!

* If you don't have a [NeSI account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/), put the pink sticker on your computer and we'll simply log you in. In a normal workshop, we would make sure every participant has access to the servers before starting the workshop but it is not possible today. Those servers are a powerful resource you can later use on your own. I encourage you to apply for an account after this workshop if it feels like it is a resource you might want to use further.

Once everybody is logged in, we'll **start the lesson together** : [Quality Control for Genomic Data](QualityControlforGenomicData.md)
